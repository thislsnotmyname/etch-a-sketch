# etch-a-sketch
This project's purpose is to create a [Etch-A-Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch)(like) drawing program using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I accomplished this with Flexbox and DOM manipulation.
If you move the mouse over the grid of "pixels," they will change to a random color and get slightly brighter.

This project was created as an exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).
